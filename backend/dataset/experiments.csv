2. Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM): measured the distribution of solar energy across different wavelengths.
3. X-Ray Photometer (XPS): measured the X-ray radiation emitted by the Sun.
4. Albedo and Clouds (AAC): measured the amount of sunlight reflected by Earth's surface and atmosphere.

simple_rag_score,What is EXP4FUSE?,Exp4Fuse is a query expansion method using a LLM to enhance sparse retrievers.,"Exp4Fuse is a rank fusion framework that indirectly improves the performance of sparse retrievers through zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. It operates in two stages: 

1. The first stage involves two retrieval routes using a similar sparse retriever. The original route follows the traditional retrieval process, where the original query is input directly into the sparse retriever to rank relevant documents. The query expansion route involves zero-shot LLM-based query expansion, where the original query is input into LLMs to generate hypothetical documents. These documents are then used to augment the original query, which is subsequently input into the sparse retriever to rank relevant documents.

2. The second stage involves fusing the document rankings from the two retrieval routes using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. The fused ranking is considered the final retrieval output of the Exp4Fuse framework.",0.07801418439716312,0.8461538461538461,0.14285714285714288

It aligns the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric called 'gain', which measures how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. GainRAG estimates these gain signals and trains a middleware that aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data.",0.4,0.967741935483871,0.5660377358490567
